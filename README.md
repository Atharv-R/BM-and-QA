# BM-and-QA

The main research idea is the following: Boltzmann Machines (BMs) lend themselves naturally to be used within quantum annealers (QA), since these ``implement" the energy-based model that a BM represents. In the traditional ML applications, Restricted BMs,  which have connections only between ``visible" (data) and ``hidden" (latent) nodes are used. These have a bipartite graph structure that allows for efficient sampling from the RBM by block Gibbs sampling. If you can sample from the RBM with a QA, there is no need for this anymore. Any BM used with QA needs to be embedded into the QA chip; that is, the graph used for the BM (looked at as a graphical model) needs to be mapped onto the graph of the QA chip. This embedding is really inefficient for bipartite graphs, ie the graph that corresponds to an RBM. So why not try working directly with the graphical architecture of the QA chip? Designate visible and hidden nodes on the chip, and use that.
